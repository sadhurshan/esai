### Added
- Supplier-authored invoicing enablement runbook ([docs/launch_ready_cleanup/supplier-invoicing-enablement.md](docs/launch_ready_cleanup/supplier-invoicing-enablement.md)) covering feature flag overrides, admin API steps, and customer communication templates.
- Changelog tracking for the supplier-invoicing release so rollout artifacts (migration plan, enablement guide, QA fixtures) stay linked for future audits.
