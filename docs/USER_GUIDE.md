# Elements Supply User Guide

Welcome to the Elements Supply workspace. This guide consolidates every guided-resolution topic surfaced by Copilot so buyers and operators can finish their work even when automation fails. Each section mirrors the workflows defined in `/docs/REQUIREMENTS_FULL.md` and the deep specs under `/deep-specs/*`.

## Draft an RFQ with Copilot
Copilot can assemble RFQ drafts automatically, but buyers should understand the manual flow in case the deterministic tools are unavailable.

1. Open **Sourcing → RFQs** and click **New RFQ**.
2. Attach engineering drawings, BOM extracts, and timing notes referenced in your Copilot chat.
3. Enter scope, timeline, and evaluation rubric. Mirror the sections Copilot listed so downstream scoring stays aligned.
4. Add the supplier list Copilot suggested, set due dates, and publish for responses.

## Compare Supplier Quotes
Follow these steps if Copilot cannot run the quote-comparison tool.

1. Navigate to **Sourcing → Quotes** and open the RFQ or shortlist Copilot referenced.
2. Export quote data or sort the grid by price, lead time, and quality ratings.
3. Apply weighting rules from the RFQ rubric and record the rationale in the activity log.

## Issue a Purchase Order
When PO drafting tools are offline, convert the Copilot recommendation manually.

1. From the RFQ award view, click **Create PO** or open **Orders → Purchase Orders → New PO**.
2. Select the awarded supplier, import the quote or RFQ lines, and verify currency plus payment terms.
3. Align delivery schedule milestones with the production plan Copilot summarized, then submit for approval.

## Receiving and Quality Review
Use this checklist to receive goods tied to a Copilot workflow.

1. Open **Receiving → Inbound** and locate the PO or shipment Copilot referenced.
2. Record quantities, serial numbers, and inspection findings. Attach photos or NCR forms if issues arise.
3. Route discrepancies through the NCR workflow or escalate to the buyer before closing the receipt.

## Resolve Invoice Exceptions
If Copilot cannot auto-reconcile invoices, follow the manual steps.

1. Go to **Finance → Invoices** and filter by the PO number cited in chat.
2. Compare billed quantities, taxes, and freight against the PO and receipts.
3. Approve clean invoices or request supplier corrections. Update the three-way match status so Copilot’s next turn sees the resolution.
