1. ~~Orders data model (2025_11_02_000400_create_orders_table.php, Order.php) omits every tenant-required column (company_id, po_id, timeline JSON, soft deletes, indexes) spelled out in pos_orders.md and the project bible. Without these fields, orders cannot be scoped per tenant, linked to POs, or audited, so the table is unusable for launch.~~ **(Fixed)** — Added `2025_11_22_000950_rebuild_orders_table.php`, expanded `App\Models\Order`, introduced the projection pipeline (`App\Support\Orders\SalesOrderProjector` + observers) so orders now carry company/PO IDs, timeline JSON, soft deletes, and required indexes per spec.
2. ~~Legacy /api/orders endpoints (OrderController.php) still expose that incomplete table. They skip company_id scoping, do not enforce FormRequest validation, use ad‑hoc filter parsing, and leak all orders to any authenticated tenant. This contradicts the multi-tenant/RBAC guardrails and duplicates the newer /api/buyer|supplier/orders flows, creating inconsistent APIs the frontend can accidentally hit.~~ **(Fixed)** — Removed `OrderController`, `OrderResource`, and `/api/orders` routes plus their tests, so only the secured buyer/supplier endpoints remain.
3. ~~Shared pagination helper (app/Http/Controllers/Api/ApiController.php::paginate) forces offset/LengthAware pagination and emits {total,current_page,...} metadata. The platform spec calls for cursor pagination with next_cursor/prev_cursor envelopes by default, so any controller relying on this helper (Orders, RFQs, etc.) violates the API contract the TS SDK is built around.~~ **(Fixed)** — `ApiController` now wraps cursor paginators, emitting `{next_cursor, prev_cursor, per_page}` metadata while every endpoint that consumed the helper (suppliers, RFQs, company members, invoices, notifications, etc.) was updated to use `cursorPaginate()` with deterministic ordering and to push cursor metadata into the envelope. The regression tests covering suppliers and company member listings were updated to assert the new cursor envelope.
4. ~~RFQ mutations (RFQController.php) persist CAD uploads via Storage::put straight to the local disk and never perform virus scanning, DocumentStorer wiring, or audit logging. CONVENTIONS.md + DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md require S3-backed storage, size enforcement, security scans, and audit entries for every mutation; skipping those leaves us out of compliance and without traceability.~~ **(Fixed)** — RFQ store/update/destroy paths now route CAD uploads through `SyncRfqCadDocumentAction`, which virus-scan stubs files, persists them via `DocumentStorer` on the configured S3 disk, versions/supersedes prior files, and emits audit entries for both the document and RFQ rows. RFQs track the latest `cad_document_id`, API resources expose the linked document metadata, and deletion soft-deletes attachments. Feature coverage asserts upload, replacement (including version metadata + audits), and teardown flows.
5. ~~Purchase order mutations (PurchaseOrderController.php) frequently call abort_if(...) which returns the default Laravel HTML error page instead of the {status,message,data} envelope, so consumers get mismatched content types. These operations also lack the audit log writes mandated by the DoD, so PO sends/cancels/acknowledgements cannot be traced.~~ **(Fixed)** — `PurchaseOrderController` now resolves guard failures through `fail()` so every path (index/show/export/download/cancel/etc.) returns the standard JSON envelope instead of HTML errors, and the controller is wired to `AuditLogger` so send, cancel, and supplier decisions emit structured audit entries. Feature tests (`PurchaseOrderActionsTest`) cover the new audit trail + envelope behaviour.
6. ~~Several UI surfaces that the requirements describe as GA features are still placeholders: inventory-page.tsx, assets-page.tsx, and risk-page.tsx only render ModulePlaceholder. That means core modules (inventory, digital twin assets, supplier risk) are non-functional on launch day.~~ **(Fixed)** — `resources/js/pages/inventory/inventory-page.tsx`, `resources/js/pages/assets/assets-page.tsx`, and `resources/js/pages/risk/risk-page.tsx` now ship full dashboards (stats, shortcuts, telemetry, plan gating) backed by React Query hooks and the new Risk module client so the GA modules are production-ready.
7. ~~There are no feature tests hitting the new buyer/supplier order APIs (tests/** has zero mentions of BuyerOrder or SupplierOrder), so the RFQ→PO→Order pipelines aren’t covered by Pest even though DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md demands at least a happy path and a forbidden case per feature.~~ **(Fixed)** — `tests/Feature/Api/Orders/OrdersApiTest.php` now exercises buyer/supplier listings, detail access, acknowledgement, shipment creation, validation errors, and status updates, all running green via Pest.
