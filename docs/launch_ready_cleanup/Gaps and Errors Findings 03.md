1. ✅ Fixed – Quote schema now mirrors the spec. Migration `2025_11_23_120000_align_quotes_schema_with_spec.php` renames legacy `note/total` columns, adds `attachments_count`, normalizes status defaults, and introduces sqlite-safe enum rewrites so the {draft,submitted,withdrawn,rejected,awarded} lifecycle is enforced everywhere. `Quote.php`, `QuoteResource.php`, `DocumentStorer.php`, and `QuoteDraftService.php` were updated to read/write the new columns and automatically maintain attachment counts.
2. ✅ Fixed – Quote items carry tenant + lifecycle metadata. The same migration backfills and requires `company_id`, timestamps, and soft deletes on `quote_items`, plus it wires the FK/index. `QuoteItem.php` and `QuoteDraftService.php` inject the tenant id during draft creation, ensuring cross-tenant filters and audit logging work per `CONVENTIONS.md`.
3. ✅ Fixed – Quote APIs match `/deep-specs/quotes.md`. `routes/api.php`, `QuoteController`, `QuoteInboxController`, and `SupplierQuoteController` now expose the RFQ-scoped POST (draft), PUT (submit), PATCH (withdraw), inbox listings, and keep supplier submissions behind the proper policies/middleware. The submission flow is verified by `tests/Feature/Api/QuoteSubmissionTest.php`.
4. ✅ Fixed – Buyer comparison endpoint implemented. `QuoteComparisonService`, `QuoteComparisonResource`, and `QuoteController::compare` deliver the normalized scoring matrix, and the new `tests/Feature/Api/QuoteComparisonTest.php` covers both the happy path and the forbidden sourcing-access case.
5. ✅ Fixed – Status lifecycle is consistent. The schema update plus `ManagesRfqAwardState` now emit `rejected` instead of the legacy `lost` flag, and the regression suite (`tests/Feature/Api/RfqLineAwardFeatureTest.php`) asserts that awarding winners lock competitors into `rejected` state.
6. ✅ Fixed – Regression coverage for compare & award flows. The new comparison test exercises the JSON envelope and ranking math, while the refreshed `RfqLineAwardFeatureTest` continues to cover success + validation/forbidden cases for awarding, satisfying the DoD requirement of at least one success + one forbidden path per feature.
