1. DownloadJobController.php, SupplierOrderController.php, BuyerOrderController.php, DigitalTwinController.php, and EventDeliveryController.php all return pagination info inside data.meta and never pass the cursor block into the envelope-level meta. Per copilot-instructions.md (“collection endpoints default to cursor pagination … meta.next_cursor/meta.prev_cursor”) and DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md this breaks the shared Axios interceptor and TS SDK assumptions, so these listings don’t expose cursors consistently. Fix by calling return $this->ok(['items' => $items], message, $meta); with $meta shaped like { next_cursor, prev_cursor, per_page }. _(✅ Completed)_

2. app/Http/Controllers/Api/CompanyInvitationController.php:28-60 still does an unbounded ->latest()->get() and returns every invitation without cursor metadata. Large tenants can’t page through historical invites and the React list will silently truncate after whatever the DB returns. Align with rfqs.md + global pagination rules by switching to cursorPaginate() with deterministic ordering and feeding the cursor data through the envelope-level meta. _(✅ Completed)_

3. app/Http/Controllers/Api/PoChangeOrderController.php:17-150 relies on abort_if and never touches AuditLogger. That violates the API envelope (HTML error responses leak out again) and the Definition of Done’s “Audit entries on mutations” requirement for propose/approve/reject flows. Swap the abort_if calls for $this->fail(...)/policy checks and emit AuditLogger entries whenever change orders are created, approved, or rejected so transitions are traceable. _(✅ Completed)_

4. app/Http/Controllers/Api/UserProfileController.php:24-45 mutates user records without any audit trail, and the invitations controller’s revoke/accept paths lack auditing as well. Per DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md and copilot-instructions.md every profile or invitation mutation must write an audit entry (who changed what, before/after). Inject AuditLogger into these controllers and log updates/deletions before returning. _(✅ Completed)_

5. There are no Pest suites covering the new download jobs module (tests/** has zero references to DownloadJob or the /api/downloads routes). Definition of Done point 8 requires “at least one success and one forbidden case per feature”, so the queue-backed export workflow is currently untested. Add feature tests that hit GET /api/downloads, POST /api/downloads, the retry path, and the signed download gate (including a forbidden company scope). _(✅ Completed)_

6. use-rfqs.ts and the RFQ list UI still send page, perPage, and tab parameters, ignore the new server-side filters (status, open_bidding, method, due_from, due_to, search), and compute totals client-side. This contradicts rfqs.md and means the UI can’t access the backend’s compliant filters or cursor tokens. Update the hook to pass the new params, consume { meta: { nextCursor, prevCursor } }, and drop the client-side filtering shim. _(✅ Completed)_

7. useCompanyMembers.ts/company-members-page.tsx still assume offset pagination (page, per_page, meta.total) even though CompanyMemberController@index now exposes cursor pagination. As a result the “Next” button never enables (meta defaults to 1 page) and tenants can’t browse beyond the first 25 members. Update the hook to send/consume cursor tokens (cursor, per_page) and teach the page to use meta.nextCursor/meta.prevCursor plus the new per-page counts. _(✅ Completed)_
