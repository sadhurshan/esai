1. ✅ Critical – OrderController.php now resolves the authenticated user, enforces the new OrderPolicy, and scopes every query by resolveUserCompanyId() so cross-tenant data cannot leak.
2. ✅ High – Finance/receiving flows (Invoice, GoodsReceiptNote, CreditNote, CreditTotals, Export, Rma, and CreateGoodsReceiptNoteAction) now rely on resolveUserCompanyId() and pass the resolved company_id through to their actions/services so multi-company users remain in-context.
3. ✅ High – CompanyApprovalController.php emits cursor pagination metadata via the shared paginate() helper, so the admin approval queue can advance using meta.next_cursor/meta.prev_cursor.
4. ✅ Medium – All admin controllers now extend ApiController, use ok()/paginate(), and therefore emit the RespondsWithEnvelope request/metadata (Plan, WebhookDelivery, WebhookSubscription, RateLimit, ApiKey, CompanyFeatureFlag, DigitalTwin*, EmailTemplate, AuditLog, Company, RoleTemplate, etc.).
5. ✅ Medium – ApprovalRuleController@index, CompanyRoleTemplateController@index, DelegationController@index, and SavedSearchController@index all use cursorPaginate() + paginate() so clients consistently receive { data.items, meta.next_cursor } for large tenant datasets.
