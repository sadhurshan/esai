1. ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/Api/DigitalTwin/AssetController.php`, `MaintenanceProcedureController.php`, `MaintenanceProcedureService.php`, and `app/Http/Controllers/Api/TaxCodeController.php` now call the new `ApiController::requireCompanyContext()` helper so multi-company/API-key flows resolve the active tenant, emit `{ status: 'error' }` envelopes when context is missing, and pass the resolved `company_id` into queries/services rather than reading `$request->user()->company_id` directly.

2. ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/Api/QuoteController.php` replaces the `abort_if` guards in `index()` and `persistQuote()` with the shared helper + envelope failures, scopes RFQs by the resolved company before authorization, and routes all policy checks through `Gate::forUser`, eliminating the cross-tenant leak while keeping clients on the JSON envelope.

3. ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/DigitalTwinController.php` and `Admin/DigitalTwinAssetController.php` no longer use `abort_*`; both resolve the admin actor via `resolveRequestUser()` and respond with `fail()` when authentication/ownership is missing, so `/api/admin/digital-twin/*` endpoints emit the standard envelope even for unauthorized paths.

4. ✅ Added dedicated Pest suites under `tests/Feature/DigitalTwin/DigitalTwinAssetsTest.php` and `DigitalTwinProceduresTest.php` (plus shared helpers) to cover GET/POST/DELETE/status flows for assets and maintenance procedures, each with at least one happy-path and one forbidden assertion. The updated suite passes (`vendor/bin/pest tests/Feature/DigitalTwin`), satisfying DoD item 8 for digital-twin runtime features.
