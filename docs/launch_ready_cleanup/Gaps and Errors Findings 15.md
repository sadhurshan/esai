1. company-member + export + goods-receipt APIs still emit offset pagination. CompanyMemberController@index (app/Http/Controllers/Api/CompanyMemberController.php, lines 27‑40), ExportController@index (app/Http/Controllers/Api/ExportController.php, lines 33‑48), and GoodsReceiptNoteController::companyIndex (app/Http/Controllers/Api/GoodsReceiptNoteController.php, lines 34‑91) all call ->paginate() and pass LengthAware metadata through ApiController::paginate(), so responses expose total/current_page instead of the {next_cursor, prev_cursor, per_page} envelope mandated in REQUIREMENTS_FULL.md (“collection endpoints default to cursor pagination”) and previously logged in docs/launch_ready_cleanup/Gaps and Errors Findings 08.md. Frontend hooks (useCompanyMembers, download center, GRN list) now expect cursor tokens and cannot advance past page 1. Fix by switching these queries to cursorPaginate(..., 'cursor', $request->query('cursor')), ensuring deterministic ordering (orderByDesc('created_at')->orderByDesc('id')), and passing the cursor block to $this->ok(). **Status: Completed—each controller now uses cursor pagination with deterministic ordering and returns the required cursor metadata.**

2. Invitations never create the pending user record the spec requires. FR‑12 §6.2 in REQUIREMENTS_FULL.md states “Each invitation creates a pending user record with token expiration (48 hours).” InviteCompanyUsersAction::execute() (app/Actions/Company/InviteCompanyUsersAction.php, lines 33‑73) only inserts into company_invitations and never provisions a users row flagged as pending, so brand‑new invitees have nothing to activate and we cannot enforce uniqueness or pre-provision RBAC. Implement a stub User (email + status=pending + company context) when the invite is created and tie the invitation to that record. **Status: Completed—InviteCompanyUsersAction now provisions/updates pending users, stores their IDs on invitations, and enforces company context + status.**

3. Accepting an invitation requires an existing authenticated session, which blocks the intended onboarding flow. api.php lines 99‑110 wrap POST /company-invitations/{token}/accept inside Route::middleware(['auth']), and CompanyInvitationController::accept() (app/Http/Controllers/Api/CompanyInvitationController.php, lines 72‑108) immediately fails when resolveRequestUser() returns null. Together with the missing pending-user creation, invited emails cannot join the tenant unless they already registered through some other path, contradicting the requirement that invitations onboard new users directly. Expose a public acceptance endpoint that verifies the token + email, lets invitees set their password, and only requires login after activation. **Status: Completed—the acceptance route is now public (auth middleware removed) and CompanyInvitationController::accept activates pending users after validating tokens/email/passwords.**

4. Invitation acceptance does not validate that the signed-in user matches the invited email. AcceptCompanyInvitationAction::execute() (app/Actions/Company/AcceptCompanyInvitationAction.php, lines 15‑68) skips any comparison between $invitation->email and $user->email, so any authenticated user who obtains a token (forwarded email, log leak, etc.) can join the tenant with whatever role was assigned. This violates the “Company Admins can invite users via email” constraint and opens privilegeescalation paths. Add a strict, case-insensitive email match (and optionally domain validation) before creating/updating memberships. **Status: Completed—acceptance now enforces a case-insensitive email match both in the controller validation layer and AcceptCompanyInvitationAction.**

5. No notification or email is sent when invitations are issued. The spec explicitly calls for email invitations, yet InviteCompanyUsersAction::execute() leaves a // TODO: dispatch notification + email once messaging service is available. comment (line 55) and never queues mail via the existing notification infrastructure. As a result, invitees are unaware of pending access, which is a launch blocker for FR‑12. Wire this action to the notification service (and queued mailers) so invitations generate the required email + in-app alert with the tokenized acceptance link. **Status: Completed—CompanyInvitationIssued notification now dispatches queued email with the acceptance link upon invite creation.**
