1. ✅ **Axios client drops cursor metadata, so React hooks can never advance past page 1.** All collection endpoints that now rely on `ApiController::paginate()` return `{ data: { items, meta: { next_cursor, prev_cursor, per_page } }, meta: { cursor: { next_cursor, prev_cursor, has_next, has_prev }, request_id } }` to satisfy the contract in `/docs/REQUIREMENTS_FULL.md` §26 and the OpenAPI fragments. However `resources/js/lib/api.ts` (lines 33‑63) spreads the payload and then unconditionally overwrites the `meta` property with the envelope metadata. As soon as a controller adopted the shared helper (company members, exports, goods receipts, etc.), `response.meta` in React became `{ request_id, cursor: { ... } }` while the `data.meta` block that actually holds `next_cursor/per_page` is discarded. `toCursorMeta` (`resources/js/lib/pagination.ts`, lines 1‑34) only inspects `meta.next_cursor` / `meta.nextCursor`, so hooks such as `useCompanyMembers` (resources/js/hooks/api/useCompanyMembers.ts, lines 64‑91) now normalize every response with `meta: undefined`. Result: the Settings > Team page cannot request the `cursor` query param or show a "Load more" button even though the backend now enforces cursor pagination; QA already hit this when CompanyMemberManagementTest was updated to assert the payload shape. Fix by merging, not replacing, the payload `meta` (same strategy already implemented in `resources/js/sdk/api-helpers.ts`) and by surfacing `cursor` at the top level so `toCursorMeta` can pick it up. _Resolved in `resources/js/lib/api.ts` by merging payload/envelope metadata and copying cursor tokens to the normalized `meta` block so hooks once again receive `next_cursor` and `prev_cursor`._

2. ✅ **Front-end invitations hook discards pagination metadata entirely.** `CompanyInvitationController@index` now emits cursor metadata, but `useCompanyInvitations` (`resources/js/hooks/api/useCompanyInvitations.ts`, lines 41‑77) normalizes the response into `{ items }` and never forwards `meta` or the server-provided `next_cursor`. The query function also never accepts a `cursor` argument. Even after fixing the Axios envelope bug, Workspace Settings → Invitations will always fetch the first page and cannot advance, contradicting the platform rule in copilot-instructions.md (“collection endpoints default to cursor pagination”) and the `/docs/ACCEPTANCE.md` checklist item that explicitly references `meta.next_cursor`. The hook needs to expose the cursor tokens exactly like `useCompanyMembers` (which already maps `meta`), otherwise large tenants will see a truncated, unsortable list. _Fixed in `resources/js/hooks/api/useCompanyInvitations.ts`, which now accepts cursor/per-page params, normalizes `meta` with `toCursorMeta`, and forwards the data so Settings pages can request subsequent pages; related invalidations were updated and callers adjusted._

3. ✅ **Multiple cursor endpoints still hand-roll incomplete metadata, violating both the spec and client expectations.** Several controllers bypass `ApiController::paginate()` and return bare `['next_cursor', 'prev_cursor']` blocks without `per_page` and without the envelope-level `meta.cursor.has_next/has_prev`. Examples:
   - `app/Http/Controllers/Api/TaxCodeController.php`, lines 33‑86.
   - `app/Http/Controllers/Api/DigitalTwin/LocationController.php`, lines 23‑86.
   - `app/Http/Controllers/Api/DigitalTwin/SystemController.php`, lines 23‑86.
   - `app/Http/Controllers/Api/DigitalTwin/AssetController.php`, lines 28‑110.

   `/docs/openapi/fragments/money_tax.yaml` declares that `GET /api/money/tax-codes` returns `meta` conforming to `CursorMeta` (next/prev/per_page + boolean flags), and the acceptance checklist calls out cursor pagination for every collection. Today those endpoints only emit optional `next_cursor` tokens, so clients cannot determine whether more pages exist, and SchemaConformance will fail once coverage is added for these paths. The fix is to reuse the shared helper (or at least mirror its `{ data.meta: { next_cursor, prev_cursor, per_page }, meta.cursor: { … } }` shape) so both the spec and the React hooks receive the same metadata envelope.
   _Updated `TaxCodeController`, `DigitalTwin\LocationController`, `DigitalTwin\SystemController`, and `DigitalTwin\AssetController` to use `ApiController::paginate()`, ensuring every cursor endpoint returns `{ data.meta }` plus `meta.cursor` with `has_next/has_prev` as defined in the project specs._
