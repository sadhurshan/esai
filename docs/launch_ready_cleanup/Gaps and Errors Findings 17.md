1. Critical – Admin company approvals reverted to offset pagination: CompanyApprovalController.php lines 37‑55 call ->paginate() (LengthAware) before piping through paginate(), so the response now emits meta.pagination.* instead of the { meta.data.next_cursor, meta.cursor.has_next } contract mandated by /[REQUIREMENTS_FULL.md](http://_vscodecontentref_/1) §26 and the acceptance checklist. The React hooks that were updated per “Gaps and Errors 09.md” expect cursor tokens only, so the admin approval queue can no longer advance past page 1. Switch the query back to cursorPaginate($perPage, ['*'], 'cursor', $request->query('cursor')) so the shared helper produces the correct cursor metadata.

	Status: Fixed in app/Http/Controllers/Api/Admin/CompanyApprovalController.php by restoring cursorPaginate() so the shared envelope returns cursor metadata again.

2. High – Company invitations index bypasses the shared paginator: CompanyInvitationController.php lines 27‑63 hand-build $meta = ['next_cursor' => …] and pass that straight into ok(). Because the array lacks the ['data'=>…, 'envelope'=>…] structure that RespondsWithEnvelope expects, data.meta never includes next_cursor/per_page and meta.cursor.has_next/has_prev is missing entirely. This contradicts the envelope spec as well as the fixes you landed in docs/launch_ready_cleanup/Gaps and Errors Findings 16.md for the hooks, leaving Settings → Invitations without any way to request the next page. Reuse ApiController::paginate() (or at least mirror its metadata shape) so the hook receives normalized cursor info.

	Status: Fixed in app/Http/Controllers/Api/CompanyInvitationController.php by routing the cursor paginator through ApiController::paginate().

3. High – Invitation acceptance ignores expiration and revocation: CompanyInvitationController::accept() (lines 84‑177) validates token/email and pending user state but never checks $invitation->isExpired() or $invitation->isRevoked(). Even invitations that were revoked or that passed the 48‑hour SLA described in REQUIREMENTS_FULL.md §12 (“Each invitation creates a pending user record with token expiration (48 hours)”) remain usable indefinitely, which is both a security gap and a spec breach. Add explicit guards (422 for expired, 410/404 for revoked) before calling AcceptCompanyInvitationAction.

	Status: Fixed in app/Http/Controllers/Api/CompanyInvitationController.php by rejecting revoked (410) and expired (422) tokens prior to AcceptCompanyInvitationAction.

4. Medium – Approval requests endpoint returns an unbounded array and no envelope metadata: ApprovalRequestController.php lines 24‑72 build a query, call ->get(), filter the collection in PHP, then return ApprovalResource::collection($approvals)->resolve() directly. There is no cursor pagination, no data.items/meta, and no meta.request_id, so the API envelope and pagination requirements in DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md points 1‑3 are violated. Large tenants will download every pending approval on each refresh. Feed the filtered query into cursorPaginate() (or a custom cursor source that still yields the same metadata shape) and return it via ok()/paginate() to keep the contract consistent.

	Status: Fixed in app/Http/Controllers/Api/ApprovalRequestController.php via buffered cursor pagination that respects the shared envelope and user scoping.

5. Medium – DocsController error responses bypass the standard envelope: When the generated OpenAPI/Postman artifact is missing, DocsController.php lines 23‑41 call response()->json([...], 404) directly. The payload omits meta.request_id and does not match { status, message, data, meta }, so consumers can’t correlate failures with request IDs and automated schema checks will fail. Have DocsController extend ApiController (or at least pull in RespondsWithEnvelope) and replace the manual JSON with $this->fail(...) so these operational endpoints still respect the platform contract.

	Status: Fixed in app/Http/Controllers/Api/DocsController.php by extending ApiController and using fail() for missing artifacts.
