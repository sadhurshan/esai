1. Critical – PO-scoped GRN listing still emits offset pagination. GoodsReceiptNoteController.php lines 228‑270 call ->paginate() and return LengthAware metadata for GET /api/purchase-orders/{po}/grns. The platform contract in REQUIREMENTS_FULL.md §26 and the launch-readiness findings (Cleanup #08) require every collection to expose cursor pagination (data.items, meta.next_cursor, meta.prev_cursor). Because this endpoint never produces cursor tokens, the PO detail page cannot request the second page of receipts and SDK helpers (which now assume cursors) silently stall. Switch the query to cursorPaginate($this->perPage(...), ['*'], 'cursor', $request->query('cursor')) with deterministic ordering (inspected_at, created_at, id), feed the result through ApiController::paginate(), and add Pest coverage asserting that meta.cursor.has_next changes when more records exist.

	_Status: ✅ Resolved via cursor pagination in `app/Http/Controllers/Api/GoodsReceiptNoteController.php` with regression coverage in `tests/Feature/Api/GoodsReceiptNoteTest.php`._

2. High – Company role template API violates the shared envelope and pagination rules. CompanyRoleTemplateController.php lines 18‑47 still use ->paginate() (offset) and return data.roles instead of data.items + meta cursor info. The React hook at useCompanyRoleTemplates.ts therefore has no way to pass or consume cursor tokens and will silently truncate results for tenants with >25 templates, while the response shape fails the { data: { items }, meta: { next_cursor… } } contract documented in API_ENVELOPE.md. Update the controller to cursorPaginate() (ordering by name then id for deterministic cursors), wrap the list in ['items' => $items, 'permission_groups' => …] so items follows the spec, and extend the hook/tests to accept the cursor param.

	_Status: ✅ Resolved with cursor pagination in `app/Http/Controllers/Api/CompanyRoleTemplateController.php`, updated hook `resources/js/hooks/api/useCompanyRoleTemplates.ts`, query keys, and new cursor tests in `tests/Feature/Api/CompanyRoleTemplateTest.php`._

3. Medium – Library digital twin guard bypasses the JSON envelope. DigitalTwinController.php lines 265‑289 call abort(Response::HTTP_NOT_FOUND, 'Digital twin not found.') when the twin isn’t published/visible. That returns Laravel’s HTML error page with no { status, message, meta.request_id }, breaking the API contract and error handling in use-dts.ts (which expects an ApiError). Replace the abort with $this->fail('Digital twin not found.', 404) so consumers always see the standard envelope, and add a regression test ensuring hidden twins yield a JSON { status: error } response.

	_Status: ✅ Resolved; controller now returns envelope errors and `tests/Feature/Api/DigitalTwinLibraryTest.php` asserts hidden twins emit `{ status: error }`._

4. Medium – Admin feature-flag mutations still throw raw HTTP errors. CompanyFeatureFlagController.php lines 69‑74 guard ownership via abort(Response::HTTP_NOT_FOUND). That again skips the envelope/request-id requirement from DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md, so the admin UI receives an HTML 404 when a flag doesn’t belong to the company. Use $this->fail('Feature flag not found for company.', 404) (or throw a policy exception) to keep auditability and extend Pest coverage for the cross-company access path.

	_Status: ✅ Resolved by routing ownership failures through the API envelope in `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/CompanyFeatureFlagController.php` with cross-company regression coverage in `tests/Feature/Api/Admin/CompanyFeatureFlagTest.php`._

5. Medium – Access-control middleware responses lack the envelope metadata. Every middleware that short-circuits API calls—e.g. EnsureEventAccess.php, EnsureSubscribed.php, EnsureRiskAccess.php, EnsureOrdersAccess.php, etc.—returns response()->json([...]) without meta.request_id or the cursor structure described in REQUIREMENTS_FULL.md. These ad-hoc payloads break the shared Axios interceptor (which expects meta) and make tracing failed requests in logs impossible. Refactor the middleware to either extend RespondsWithEnvelope or delegate to a small helper (e.g., return app(ApiController::class)->fail(...)) so every rejection includes the standard { status, message, data, meta.request_id }.

	_Status: ✅ Resolved by introducing `App\Support\ApiResponse` and updating all middleware (e.g., `EnsureSubscribed`, `EnsureEventAccess`, `EnsureCompanyOnboarded`, `AdminGuard`, etc.) to emit envelope-compliant errors._
