1. ~~StoreRfqRequest.php (lines 8‑31) still hard-codes max:10240 for CAD uploads. documents.md and FR‑8 call for a configurable 50 MB limit derived from config('documents.max_size_mb'). Any admin override or future plan tier change is ignored, so valid RFQ CAD files >10 MB continue to fail validation even though storage + virus scanning layers accept them. Mirror the pattern used in StoreDocumentRequest (compute KB from config + centralized extension whitelist).~~ **(Fixed)** — `StoreRfqRequest` now pulls extensions via `InteractsWithDocumentRules` and computes the max size (in KB) from `documents.max_size_mb`, keeping CAD validation aligned with the configuration.

2. ~~StoreDocumentRequest.php (lines 16‑37) never lets buyers attach files to Orders because ENTITY_MAP omits the Order model. FR‑8 explicitly says “Per order/project, store technical, commercial, QA, logistics, financial, and communication documents.” As-is, POST /documents rejects any entity=order, so order history can’t satisfy audit requirements. Extend the entity map (and related policies/resources) to include orders and ensure tests cover uploads + retrieval.~~ **(Fixed)** — The documents FormRequest now imports `Order` and exposes an `order` entity mapping so uploads/readbacks work for PO-derived orders.

3. ~~SupplierController.php (lines 90‑134) collapses every sort=match_score|distance|price_band branch into a TODO fallback that simply orders by rating. suppliers.md requires those sort modes (match score, geodistance, price band) for the directory. Without the real scoring logic—capability fit, geo calculations, or price band buckets—buyers can’t prioritize suppliers per spec, and the React filters mislead users.~~ **(Fixed)** — `SupplierController` now computes the weighted match score (ratings, lead‑time clamp, verification signals, certificate count), applies driver-aware distance ordering (Haversine for MySQL/Postgres, absolute delta fallback for sqlite), and orders price bands with the specified bucket + MOQ fallback. Regression coverage lives in `tests/Feature/Api/SupplierDirectoryTest.php` (“sorts suppliers by match score/distance/price band”).

4. ~~RmaService.php (lines 186‑212 & 292‑302) never triggers credit notes when an RMA resolution is “credit/refund” and never propagates RMA outcomes into supplier performance metrics. FR‑17 ties RMAs and credit notes together (“Credit Notes… linked to PO/GRN”) and mandates that “All RMAs and credits are logged and reflected in supplier performance metrics.” Those TODOs mean finance has to re-enter data manually and supplier risk dashboards ignore quality returns. Wire the credit-note action (or emit a domain event the billing service can consume) and persist defect counts so SupplierRiskService can ingest them.~~ **(Fixed)** — Approved credit/refund RMAs now auto-generate draft credit notes tied to the source invoice/PO, defect quantities are stored on each RMA, and `SupplierRiskService` ingests both RMA counts and credit note activity when computing defect rates/badges.

5. ~~app/Services/GlobalSearchService.php::searchParts (around lines 150‑195) admits “parts tags not persisted yet” and fakes tag filters by scanning rfq_items.spec. FR‑18 requires “Advanced filters by status, date range, entity type, and tag.” Because tags are neither stored nor indexed, tags[]=cnc just becomes a LIKE '%cnc%' on freeform spec text, which produces false positives and can’t respect the structured tag catalog the SDK and UI expose. Persist part tags (table or JSON column), index them, and update this query to filter against the canonical data.~~ **(Fixed)** — Added the tenant-scoped `part_tags` table/model (with normalized indexes + factory hooks), `Part::syncTags()` helper, and updated `GlobalSearchService` to query canonical `parts` data, expose tags in responses, and apply case-insensitive tag filters backed by persisted records. Coverage now lives in `tests/Feature/Api/SearchControllerTest.php` (“filters parts by tags”).

6. ~~Kernel.php plus the jobs directory never defines or schedules the spec-mandated ComputeTenantUsageJob. Section 9.5 of REQUIREMENTS_FULL.md states “Nightly job to recompute usage (ComputeTenantUsageJob) and store snapshots.” Without it, the admin console’s usage cards and plan limit enforcement fall out of sync, and AT‑20.5 (“Usage cards match snapshot totals”) can’t pass. Implement the job and register it in the scheduler alongside the other nightly tasks.~~ **(Fixed)** — Added the `usage_snapshots` table/model (with factory + `Company` relation), implemented the queued `ComputeTenantUsageJob` to aggregate per-tenant RFQ/quote/PO/storage metrics for a given day, and scheduled it at 02:30 in `Kernel.php`. Regression coverage lives in `tests/Feature/Jobs/ComputeTenantUsageJobTest.php` (“creates or updates usage snapshots for each tenant on the target date”).

7. ~~CompanyApprovalController.php (lines 52-55 & 94-97) approves/rejects companies silently; both spots have TODOs to notify the owners. The Definition of Done lists “Notifications wired” for every mutation, and FR-12’s lifecycle means owners are waiting on those approvals to unlock supplier actions. Right now the only signal is a manual page refresh in Settings, which is easy to miss. Emit the usual notification/audit events so owners and platform ops both get status changes.~~ **(Fixed)** — The approval/rejection endpoints now call the new `CompanyApproved`/`CompanyRejected` notifications for both the tenant owner and platform operators, delivering mail + in-app alerts. Regression coverage lives in `tests/Feature/Api/Admin/CompanyApprovalControllerTest.php` (“notifies owners and platform operators when a company is approved/rejected”).
