1. ~~High – Quote comparison scoring ignores the spec-mandated “fit” signal. QuoteComparisonService.php (lines 23‑63) only normalizes price, lead time, and supplier rating. §“Quote comparison by fit/lead/price/risk with explanations” in REQUIREMENTS_FULL.md (around line 1697) requires capability-fit to be part of the composite score so buyers can understand why a supplier is recommended. Pull the existing supplier match score (capability overlap + geo/price band logic already implemented for the directory) into this service, expose it in the payload, and rebalance the weighting so all four axes match the spec.~~ **(Fixed)** — `QuoteComparisonService` now injects a dedicated `SupplierFitService` that scores capability overlap, geo alignment, and price-band tiers per RFQ; the API exposes the normalized `fit` axis alongside price/lead/risk, and the React compare table/SDK types render the fourth axis with the updated weighting.

2. ~~High – Quote comparison responses do not surface supplier approval status or certificate health. QuoteResource currently returns only supplier.id and supplier.name; the comparison grid therefore cannot fulfil the requirement in REQUIREMENTS_FULL.md (“Supplier Onboarding & KYC Verification”, item 1.5) that “A supplier’s approval status and document validity appear in search results and quote comparisons.” Extend the resource/serializer to include the supplier’s status, verification timestamp, and the latest compliance document expiries/flags so the UI can highlight risky suppliers before award.~~ **(Fixed)** — `QuoteResource` now serializes supplier status, verification timestamps, company approval state, and a compliance summary (certificate counts + next expiries), the comparison API eager-loads these relations, and the React comparison grid can read the richer payload to flag risky suppliers.

3. ~~Medium – The documents API can’t associate files with Goods Receipt Notes, NCRs, RMAs, or credit notes, even though FR‑8 (“Per order/project, store technical, commercial, QA, logistics, financial, and communication documents”) and the “Goods Receipt & Quality Inspection” section (Must-add §8) explicitly call for QA attachments. StoreDocumentRequest::ENTITY_MAP lacks entries for GoodsReceiptNote, Ncr, Rma, CreditNote, etc., so uploads to those records are rejected with “entity not allowed.” Add the missing morph targets, update policies/resources, and add regression tests covering QA document upload/download paths.~~ **(Fixed)** — `StoreDocumentRequest` now whitelists the QA entities (`grn`, `goods_receipt_note`, `ncr`, `rma`, `credit_note`), and `DocumentUploadTest` includes regression coverage that exercises uploads for each model so QA attachments can be stored and retrieved per spec.

4. ~~sMedium – Inventory forecast snapshots are not implemented or scheduled. FR‑9 bullet 2 in REQUIREMENTS_FULL.md lists “inventory forecast snapshots” as one of the baseline export/report datasets, yet the codebase contains no model/migration/job for forecasts and Kernel.php still has a TODO about deciding whether a snapshot job should run. Without a nightly aggregation similar to ComputeTenantUsageJob, the reporting requirements and CSV exports for forecasts cannot be met. Define the snapshot table, implement a job that rolls up safety stock / projected run-out per part, and schedule it alongside the other nightly tasks.~~ **(Fixed)** — The `forecast_snapshots` table now tracks avg daily demand, safety stock, run-out, and horizon days; the queued `ComputeInventoryForecastSnapshotsJob` aggregates per-part metrics nightly (scheduled in `Kernel.php`), and regression coverage verifies the snapshot payload.
