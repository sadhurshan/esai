1. High – Buyer workflows blocked until company approval (EnsureCompanyApproved.php L14-63, api.php L216-320). **Status: ✅ Satisfied.** `EnsureCompanyApproved` now whitelists `pending_verification` companies so new tenants can create RFQs, invite users, etc. without waiting for ops approval, while suspended tenants remain blocked. Added `EnsureCompanyApprovedTest::it allows pending verification companies through the middleware` to guard against regressions.

2. Medium – Buyer admins cannot apply as suppliers (RoleTemplateDefinitions.php L5-68). **Status: ✅ Satisfied.** Buyer admins inherit `suppliers.apply` via `RoleTemplateDefinitions`, and `SupplierApplicationLifecycleTest` now proves buyer admins can submit while other roles are still rejected. Unit tests also assert the permission mapping.

3. Medium – Supplier-role invitations allowed before supplier approval (StoreCompanyInvitationRequest.php L11-39, InviteCompanyUsersAction.php L24-86). **Status: ✅ Satisfied.** Both the request validator and `InviteCompanyUsersAction` enforce `company->isSupplierApproved()` before permitting `supplier_admin` / `supplier_estimator` invites, with `CompanyInvitationController` returning an envelope-compliant 422. `CompanyInvitationAcceptanceTest` covers the guard.

4. Question – Supplier application blocked until buyer approval (SupplierApplicationController.php L54-71). **Status: ✅ Satisfied.** Pending-verification companies now pass the status gate when submitting supplier applications, honoring FR-12. `SupplierApplicationLifecycleTest` asserts the pending path succeeds and transitions the company into supplier review.
